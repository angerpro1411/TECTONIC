The last one who works and synthesizable is AXI_LITE_SLAVE_VHD_OLDVERSION. This one is modified from my_AXI_SLAVE. 
The problem of my_AXI_SLAVE is that works with VHDL2008 and VIVADO of Xilinx doesn't support synthezise VHDL2008,
so it is impossible to create IP and testing after RTL code.
Target is Zedboard and Zynq7000
