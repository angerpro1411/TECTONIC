This folder includes processed big map and the small frames that are cut from big map. We will process each small frame to see the result.
Our objectives are always to detect houses and trees in map, also locate their coordinates and their angles.
Inside each small frame, we did : 
1. Well seperated each object.
2. Clear the shadow.
3. Remove some details could reduce the effectiveness of algorithm.

We can actually see every step of process from original to the last result.
