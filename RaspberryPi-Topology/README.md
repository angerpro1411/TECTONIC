2. In this project :
I used Raspberry 4 model B to add the OS inside, you can choose whatever you want but recommended with reduce time to stay with choosing OS
we can choose the avaible in rpi-imager by install the rpi-imager package in Ubuntu.
Attention! Don't forget to attach your SD card in to your PC/laptop.
> sudo apt-get install rpi-imager
> rpi-imager

2.1. Pick to choose OS.
- You can choose, so many OS, but i did choose an OS Lite in Raspberry Pi OS(other) without desktop envriroment(GNU - GNOME), more lightweight and our purpose is only 
control GPIO, not to display hdmi to screen. You can choose RaspDebian 64 without OS.
